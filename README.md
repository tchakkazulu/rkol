rkol
====

Radio KoL stuff. Eventually, this'll be the place where my in-game and IRC RKoL-announcebots can be found.

It also features rkol.pl, an XChat 2 Perl script that has the schedule query interface.

Old code is in old/. It contains an IRC-announcebot and an in-game announcebot, as well as a script that fetches the DJ Mapping page on the wiki.

I'm starting a new bot (for both in-game announcements and IRC announcements) in tchakkabot/
