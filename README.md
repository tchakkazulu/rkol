rkol
====

Radio KoL stuff. Eventually, this'll be the place where my in-game and IRC RKoL-announcebots can be found.

It also features rkol.pl, an XChat 2 Perl script that has the schedule query interface.


djmaps.hs grabs the DJ Mapping page and saves it to djmaps.txt.

The IRC folder contains the RKoL IRC bot, the game folder has code for KoL.
